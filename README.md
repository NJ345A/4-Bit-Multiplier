# 4-Bit-Multiplier
A 4-bit multiplier is a digital circuit that multiplies two 4-bit binary numbers, producing an 8-bit output

 It uses logic gates such as AND gates and adders to perform binary multiplication efficiently.
 
 Commonly used in microprocessors, arithmetic units, and embedded systems, the 4-bit multiplier is valued for its simplicity,
 speed, and low power consumption, making it a crucial building block in more complex digital systems
